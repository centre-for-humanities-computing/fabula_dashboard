#### **Flesch Grade**: A revised version of the Flesch Reading Ease score. Like the former, it is based on the average sentence length (ASL), and the number of syllables per word (ASW).

#### **Dale-Chall Score**: It is based on the average sentence length (ASL) and the percentage of "difficult words" (PDW) - words which less than 80 percent of fifth-graders would know, contained in the Dale-Chall word-list.
