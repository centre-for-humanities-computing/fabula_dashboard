#### **Flesch Ease**: A measure of readability based on the average sentence length (ASL), and the average syllables per word (word length)(ASW), with a higher weight on the word length (Crossley et al., 2011). It should be noted that the weight on word lengths is higher in the Flesch Reading Ease score compared to the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level. It returns a readability score between 0 and 100, where higher scores are better (Hartley, 2016). The formula is: Flesch Reading Ease = 206.835 - (1.015 * sentence length) + (84.6 * word length). Why it was selected It’s one of the most common scores and has in several publications been argued to be the best measure compared to other readability scores (see Hartley, 2016) It does not return a US grade (compared to all other scores), which might be a bit difficult to interpret, but instead returns a score. What to be aware of (also described in Hartley, 2016) The score might be outdated and has several issues, which also apply to other readability scores (Hartley, 2016): Many syllables does not mean that a word is more difficult to understand The meaning of words is not taken into account There are individual differences between readers [Read More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests)
#### **Flesch Grade**: A revised version of the Flesch Reading Ease score. Like the former, it is based on the average sentence length (ASL), and the number of syllables per word (ASW). It also weighs word length more than sentence length, but the weight is smaller compared to that in the Flesch Reading Ease Score. It returns a US grade level (Crossley et al., 2011). The formula is: Flesch Kincaid Grade Level =(0.39 * sentence length) + (11.8 * word length) -15.59. Why it was selected It’s also one of the most common and traditional scores to assess readability. What to be aware of See Flesch Reading Ease above The score was initially developed for document for the US Navy, so it might be questioned how well it applies to literature [Read More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests)
#### **Smog**: A readability score introduced by McLaughlin. It measures readability based on the average sentence length and number of words with more than 3 syllables (number of polysyllables), and returns a US grade. However, it does this by defining all words with 3 or more syllables as polysyllables, rather than using word length as a continuous measure. It was developed as an easier (and more accurate) alternative to the Gunning Fog Index, and is based on the McCall-Crabbs Standard Test Lessons in Reading (Zhou et al., 2017). The formula is: SMOG Index = 1.0430 * number of polysyllables * 30number of sentences+ 3.1291. Why it was selected The main reason for selecting this measure was as a (better) alternative to the Gunning Fog Index, and as an alternative to the Flesch scores McCall-Crabbs Standard Test Lessons in Reading contain non-fiction but also fiction texts, which might be relevant for the texts we are looking at. What to be aware of The SMOG Index is widely used for health documents, so it is unclear how accurate this score is when it is applied to literature The McCall-Crabbs Standard Test Lessons in Reading have been revised multiple times, which means that the formula itself might also be inaccurate (Zhou et al., 2017) [Read More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMOG)
#### **ARI**: A readability score based on the average sentence length and number of characters per words (word length), and returns a US grade. However, the word length is not defined by the number of syllables, but by the number of characters in the word. It was developed to test readability of documents from the US Air Force, and was defined using 24 books and their associated grade levels (Zhou et al., 2017). The formula is: ARI = 4.71 characterswords + 0.5 wordssentences -21.43. Why it was selected It was mostly selected as it uses an alternative measure of word length, compared to the Flesch scores and the SMOG Index. What to be aware of Since it was developed for rather technical documents it may be debated how well it applies to literature [Read More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_readability_index)
#### **Dale-Chall Score**: A 1995 revision of the Dale-Chall readability score. It is based on the average sentence length (ASL) and the percentage of "difficult words" (PDW) which were defined as words which do not appear on a list of words which 80 percent of fifth-graders would know, contained in the Dale-Chall word-list. The Dale-Chall Readability Score also returns a US grade, but is different from all other scores, as it does not determine difficulty of words based on their length, but based on a predefined list. The raw score is adjusted, by adding 3.6365, if the number of difficult words (all words not on the list of familiar words) is above 5%. The formula to compute the raw score is as follows: New Dale Chall Readability Score = 0.1579 (difficult wordswords*100) + 0.0496 (wordssentences). Why it was selected This score was mainly selected as it addresses an issue of all other scores, namely that long words are not necessarily difficult to understand (e.g. interesting is a long word, but may be familiar to many and thus easy to read). What to be aware of The list of familiar words may not apply to all students and genres of text Since the list of familiar words is based on 5th grade students, this index may be most relevant in the given age group [Read More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale%E2%80%93Chall_readability_formula)
