This web-app lets you uplaod a text, calculate a large number of text metrics and compare these to 
a large corpus of canonical texts identified and analysed by Fabula-NET. 

Fabula-Net is a project that aims at studying the concept of literary quality from a quantitative, text-based perspective. Through the years we have accumulated a large corpus of English language novels with an unprecedented number of “reception proxies” or “quality proxies” – measures that gauge (from the perspective of different groups or readers) how good or bad a novel was perceived to be. 

We have found many things. 
- Readers tend to have idiosyncratic tastes (of course!) but readerships converge on groups of titles in the long-run. The best example of this phenomenon would be what we call “the literary canon” (Homer’s Odyssey appears to have enthusiastic fans in archaic Greece, Ancient Rome, Middle-Age Byzantium, XVIII century France, XX century Japan ….) which makes quality in literature a semi-subjective matter.

- Fast spreading books – books that sell lots of copies, get a lot of reviews and are read a lot in a short amount of time – have macro-scale textual profiles that are distinguishable and even predictable. The same happens for books that move slower, but resist through the decades (“pass the test of time”) and often end up in prestigious anthologies and are taught at universities.

- Novels with sentimental arcs that are too predictable are not very capturing; the same holds for novels with sentimental arcs that are too chaotic.

- Ease of reading and formulaic redundancy allow books to spread fast. This is a communicative strategy observed in wider scenarios and that trades economy for effectiveness. It can be used to pass a message in suboptimal communicative or cognitive states.

- Books that use denser and more difficult stylistic and syntactic features are more cognitively demanding, but provide richer information (they seem to spread slower though).

- Canonical books are neither sad nor boring – in fact, they are more daring and have a more positive overall tone than popular books!

- There are “optimal balance points” between coherence and uncertainty that satisfy different types of readers. Bestsellers vs. canonical works is the most obvious example, but there are many others.

- Some authors display writing characteristics that belong to both bestsellers and high-brow canonical works. Some of these authors managed to write books that were both best sellers and highly praised by the critics – Ernst Hemingway and John Steinbeck are the most evident examples in our corpus.

In this interface, we hope you can use some of these findings to gauge your texts against the parameters of our corpus. We hope you won’t use it to look like somebody else, but to find new ways to write and edit your texts, and to explore new possibilities. Remember: at night all roads lead to Rome.
